# foreverbin
ForeverBin is a website that will permanently "store" text/pastes. It works by storing everything directly in the URL. This means that once a URL is generated, it cannot ever be removed or taken down. All of the information inside of the paste is stored inside of the URL.

## How to use
[Visit the website here](https://vgmoose.github.io/foreverbin), enter some text, and then copy the URL to send it to someone else. As you type, the URL will change.

## Why?
Many paste services are used simply because it's impractical to send the text over the current chat medium. In this scenario, it may be overkill to upload an entire file to some third party server. This not only requires the third party server to have their infrastructure active and accessible, but it may be removed at any time by either the user or the service. 

Foreverbin aims to solve this problem by treating the text as text, rather than a file. For instance, if it's impractical to squeeze a document in an environment, such as an IM conversation, a Foreverbin link is as permanent as any other text in the conversation should be as considered. The generated URL will always work, but it only "exists" within that conversation, just like any other text in that conversation exists.

If the document sensitive, and shouldn't exist permanently, than another paste service should be used instead. Foreverbin links can't be removed, as aren't stored anywhere.
